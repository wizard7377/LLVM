* Differences from the LLVM C/C++ API and/or LLVM IR 

While this library is in large part based on the LLVM C/C++ API and LLVM IR, there are some differences that are worth noting.

** Instruction destination 

In this library, all statements must be have a target (this may be a trash register).

** Generalized values 

This library has a more flexible values than the LLVM C++ API. 
Rather than a global variable class /global variable/ concept, it instead just uses names to model it
