* Idris LLVM
Here, we attempt to create a simple LLVM implementation, designed to be used in Idris

** The Design
The design of this library was to make it as "functional" as possible.
This included a number of things, including adding structure to fields and requiring certain invariants.
Further, there is also a "proof" section dedicated to writing safe assembly.

*** Differences from LLVM
While there are many differences here from LLVM, most of them are an oversight and not my actual intent, however, a few places
